# pdfminer-textmining-word2vec-img2vec

This projects finished the following things:

1. Use PdfMiner and PyPdf2 to extract text and images from pdf files [Here](https://github.com/weimin17/pdfminer-textmining-word2vec-img2vec/tree/master/codes/textmining)

2. Implement NLP tutorials: preprocessing and word2vec in Gensim and NLTK [Here](https://github.com/weimin17/pdfminer-textmining-word2vec-img2vec/tree/master/codes/textmining)

3. Use pre-trained models (or do not pre-trained) in PyTorch to extract vector embeddings from any image and calculate their similarity. [Here](https://github.com/weimin17/pdfminer-textmining-word2vec-img2vec/tree/master/codes/img2vec)
